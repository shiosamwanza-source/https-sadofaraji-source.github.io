### About the Author

Sado Faraji writes stories where power is questioned, memory refuses erasure, and resistance is born from conscience. His fiction blends political thought, spiritual tension, and human struggle into narratives that explore what systems demand — and what people are willing to give.

From epic fantasy to historical resistance, his work lives at the intersection of belief, authority, and the cost of freedom.
- Belief, obedience, and conscience  
- Historical and political thought  
- Fiction shaped by philosophical and moral questions  

This website presents my books, essays, and ongoing work.
